<b>Maddison World Economy 2018</b>
</div>

<div class="content"> The graphs and plots on this page propose a way to visualise the data collected by Maddison World Economy project. 
The data used are from the 2018 update. The purpose of this project is to collect information about economy over the years for all countries. 
All the graphs and maps are interactive. Some maps contains animation that are playing automatically. Either leave the animation playing, 
pause and play it using the "Pause" and "Play" buttons or choose the year using the slider.

Mind the y axis which uses log scale. The global GDP is growing over the time from the end of the 13th century. The previous
 section showed that the number of countries increases as the time hence the GDP boost could be biaised by the increasing number of countries. 
The graph on the right hand side highlights the GDP averaged per country. It indicates between the 13th century and the 18th century that the GDP
averaged is almost constant. Then, from the 18th century the GDP averaged clearly increases, it can still be biaised by the varying number of 
countries. However, from 1950 until 2016 the number of countries is constant (169) and the GDP grows by around 7 fold.<br><br>

displayed when both population and GDP are available. Countries are colored by continents. When scroll over the years, it can be seen the impact
of crisis (i.e. wars) on the economy and population. On the year 2016, the European countries are globally the wealthiest. On the opposite 
direction the African countries are globally the poorest. Asian countries sit in between with some countries comparable to European's and some 
other similar as Asia's.

 27 fold). The population has been doubled, 31 million to 67 million inhabitants. The effect of the two world war can be seen on the population 
and the economy.
